{"name":"KCVL","tagline":"kcvl","body":"### KCVL\r\nKCVL is a *prototype* implementation of the OMG [Common Variability Language](http://www.omgwiki.org/variability/doku.php) with several additional features. KCVL comes with a textual editor for expressing variability abstraction models, variability realization models and resolution models. Several services are built around this textual representation, including:\r\n\r\n* The manipulation of base architecture models expressed in different formalisms such as [UML](http://marketplace.obeonetwork.com/module/uml), [EMF Ecore](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) or [Capella](https://www.polarsys.org/proposals/capella). Any MOF-compliant language can be integrated with little effort.\r\n* An interpreter for deriving specific products architectures from a common base model\r\n* A binding to [FAMILIAR](http://familiar-project.github.io/) for manipulating and reasoning about (multiple) feature models\r\n* New variability realization concepts leveraging [EMF Diff/Merge](http://eclipse.org/diffmerge/) patterns mechanism\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nKCVL is bundled as a set of Eclipse plugins.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Eclipse Juno (3.8/4.2)\r\n* Xtext 2.3.1\r\n* EMF Diff/Merge + EMF Diff/Merge patterns\r\n* Sirius\r\n* Groovy-Eclipse\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n_Help -> Install New Software..._\r\n\r\n* Update Site: https://ci.inria.fr/k3al/job/kcvl/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/fr.inria.diverse.kcvl.p2updatesite/target/site/\r\n* Continuous Integration: https://ci.inria.fr/k3al/job/kcvl/\r\n\r\n### Quick Start\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
